# Text-Classification-using-BERT

In this blog, we will take you through an example of fine-tuning BERT for text classification using the Huggingface Transformers library on the kaggle problem "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started"

This contains code for the article https://medium.com/@shwet.prakash97/fine-tune-bert-for-text-classification-using-huggingface-transformers-in-python-5215af777ecc. All has been done and implemented in singly Jupyter file on Google colab.
